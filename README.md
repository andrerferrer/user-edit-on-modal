# GOAL

This is a demo to show-case how to implement the [`geocoder` gem](https://github.com/alexreisner/geocoder#geocoding-objects) in a model, adding two coordinates.

[You can also check my other demos](https://github.com/andrerferrer/dedemos/blob/master/README.md#ded%C3%A9mos).

## What needs to be done?

### If you want to check it locally
```sh
repo_name = "user-edit-on-modal"
gh_repository='git@github.com:andrerferrer/$repo_name.git'
git clone $gh_repository demo
cd demo
bundle install
yarn install
rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
rails s

# now you can go to http://localhost:3000/
```


And we're good to go ðŸ¤“

Good Luck and Have Fun
